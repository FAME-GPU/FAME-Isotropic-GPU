# FAME-Isotropic-GPU #
The goal of FAME-Isotropic-GPU is to solve the energy band of photonic crystal and get the accurate information of its energy band as soon as possible. For a better computational efficiency, we implemented the FAME-Isotropic-GPU version, it can get more than a hundred times the efficiency of the CPU.  The design of FAME-Isotropic-GPU  allows scientists to download and use it easily, and users can use it without knowing complicated mathematical models and calculation methods.

## Installation ##
1. Download **FAME-Isotropic-GPU** form Github.
2. Install **CUDA** (version 10.0) and **LAPACK** (version 3.8.0) on your system.
3. In Makefile,
> + set the **GPU_TARGET** (Line 15).
> + set the **CUDADIR** (Line 27).
> + set the **LAPACKDIR** (Line 35).
4. Command `make` or `make -j <num>` to compile FAME-Isotropic-GPU. 
5. If successful, you will see the **Main.out** executable file.
6. Before excuting Main.out, user need to set two files: **Popt.txt** and **Material data**.
7. If all settings are completed, command `./Main.out`, FAME-Isotropic-GPU will start working.
